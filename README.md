# All-Clones Project

1. **Push Code to Your Respective Folder Only**
   - Each trainee has their own designated folder (e.g., `sujal/`, `yashika/`)
   - Always push your code to your assigned folder only
   - Do not modify or push code to folders belonging to other trainees

2. **Folder Structure**
   - Keep your projects organized within your folder
   - Create separate subfolders for each clone project
   - Follow consistent naming conventions for your project folders

3. **Code Quality**
   - Write clean, well-commented code
   - Follow best practices for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
   - Test your projects thoroughly before pushing
